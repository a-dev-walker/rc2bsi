Scripts to assist with communicating between a redcap database and our internal BSI system (reearch laboratory inventory system)


Frameowrk for establishing a one way data transfer from the CHLA internal BSI system to a REDCap Database maintained by one of the research laboratories at the hospital or at the Univeristy of Southern California. 

This code must be customized for every research project as the API for BSI is very rigid. Research laboratory must work with the CHLA Research Biorepository to finalize the variables to be transferred between the two databases.
